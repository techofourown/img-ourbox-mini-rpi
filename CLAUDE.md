# OurBox Matchbox image repo notes

This repository builds the OS image for the OurBox Matchbox (Raspberry Pi-class) hardware.

## Naming conventions

- **Model = size/form-factor class** (physical contract).
- **Trim = intent label** (Base, Harvest, Forge).
- **SKU = exact BOM + software build**; SKU identifiers must be TOO-prefixed part numbers.

Example SKU used by this repo: `TOO-OBX-MBX-BASE-001`.
