# OurBox Mini host contracts

This repo produces an OS image that guarantees a small set of contracts. These contracts are the
interface between “image build” and “k8s/apps”.

## Contract: Release metadata

### File

- `/etc/ourbox/release`

### Format

Line-oriented `KEY=VALUE` pairs (shell-friendly). Example keys:

- `OURBOX_PRODUCT`
- `OURBOX_DEVICE`
- `OURBOX_TARGET`
- `OURBOX_SKU`
- `OURBOX_VARIANT`
- `OURBOX_VERSION`
- `OURBOX_RECIPE_GIT_HASH` (recommended)

### Why it exists

- debugging (“what build is on this device?”)
- fleet management (“what should this be running?”)
- predictable support (“we can reproduce your image”)

## Contract: Storage (DATA NVMe)

### Rule

- The DATA drive is **ext4** with filesystem label: `OURBOX_DATA`
- It mounts at: `/var/lib/ourbox`

### Implementation

`/etc/fstab` includes a label-based mount, typically:

```fstab
LABEL=OURBOX_DATA /var/lib/ourbox ext4 defaults,noatime,nofail,x-systemd.device-timeout=10 0 2
```

Key properties:

* uses **LABEL** (not `/dev/nvme0n1p1`) to survive device enumeration changes
* uses `nofail` so the system can boot without the data disk
* uses a short systemd timeout to avoid slow boots

### Intended contents of `/var/lib/ourbox`

This is where higher-level stacks should store persistent state:

* k3s storage / persistent volumes
* application state
* logs (if desired)

(Exact directory layout is owned by the k8s/apps layer.)

## Contract: SSD hygiene

* `fstrim.timer` is enabled so periodic TRIM runs automatically.

Verify:

```bash
systemctl status fstrim.timer --no-pager
```

## Non-contracts (explicitly not guaranteed)

* No guarantee that Wi‑Fi is configured on first boot
* k3s is part of the OS image (as the “platform runtime”), but application manifests live elsewhere
* The OS includes `ourbox-bootstrap.service` which brings up k3s and applies baseline manifests
* If k3s can’t start because the kernel lacks the memory cgroup controller, the remedy is the
  cmdline flags (see [`docs/OPS.md`](../OPS.md) troubleshooting)
* No guarantee that the DATA disk is formatted automatically (we expect it to be labeled upfront)

## Contract: Platform runtime (k3s)

* `k3s` binary exists at `/usr/local/bin/k3s`
* `k3s.service` exists and is enabled by bootstrap (or enabled directly)
* `ourbox-bootstrap.service` exists and runs on first boot
* Success marker: `/var/lib/ourbox/state/bootstrap.done`
* k3s data lives under `/var/lib/ourbox/k3s`

## Contract: Kernel cmdline must enable cgroup memory

If `/sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.controllers` does not include `memory`, k3s will fail with
`failed to find memory cgroup (v2)`.

Fix: add `cgroup_enable=cpuset cgroup_enable=memory cgroup_memory=1` to
`/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt`. See [`docs/OPS.md`](../OPS.md) for the full procedure.

Long-term intent: bake this into the image during build.
